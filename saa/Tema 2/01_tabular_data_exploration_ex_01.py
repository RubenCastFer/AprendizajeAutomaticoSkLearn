# %% [markdown]
# Imagine we are interested in predicting penguins species based on two of their
# body measurements: culmen length and culmen depth. First we want to do some
# data exploration to get a feel for the data.
#
# What are the features? What is the target?

# %% [markdown]
# The data is located in `../datasets/penguins_classification.csv`, load it with
# `pandas` into a `DataFrame`.

# %%
# Write your code here.

penguinsClassifi= pd.read_csv('../datasets/penguins_classification.csv')
# %% [markdown]
# Show a few samples of the data.
#
# How many features are numerical? How many features are categorical?

# %%
# Write your code here.
penguinsClassifi.head()
# %% [markdown]
# What are the different penguins species available in the dataset and how many
# samples of each species are there? Hint: select the right column and use the
# [`value_counts`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.value_counts.html)
# method.

# %%
# Write your code here.
penguinsClassifi['Species'].value_counts()
# %% [markdown]
# Plot histograms for the numerical features

# %%
# Write your code here.
# solution
_ = penguinsClassifi.hist(figsize=(20, 14))
# %% [markdown]
# Show features distribution for each class. Hint: use
# [`seaborn.pairplot`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.pairplot.html)

# %%
# Write your code here.
_ = sns.pairplot(penguinsClassifi, hue="Species")
# %% [markdown]
# Looking at these distributions, how hard do you think it will be to classify
# the penguins only using `"culmen depth"` and `"culmen length"`?
